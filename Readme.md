# Air Quality Prediction App 


## Dependencies:

The following libraries and tools will be used for the development of the Air Quality Prediction App:

Python (version 3.x)
Web scraping library (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
Flask (optional) for web application development



## Instructions for Running the App:

To run the Air Quality Prediction App, follow these steps:

Install Python (version 3.x) and the required libraries mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory using the command line or terminal.
Run the web scraping script to fetch historical air quality data from the selected source.
Run the data preprocessing and feature engineering scripts to prepare the data for model training.
Execute the machine learning model training script to train the model on the preprocessed data.
Save the trained model to a file for future use.
Run the web interface or command-line application to enable users to input meteorological conditions and receive air quality predictions from the model.



## Conclusion:

The Air Quality Prediction App provides a powerful tool for predicting air quality levels in urban areas based on historical air quality and meteorological data. By employing machine learning techniques and a user-friendly interface, the app aims to assist individuals, environmentalists, and policymakers in making informed decisions to improve air quality and public health in urban regions.
